Hey there, I'm Yunho. I am a student studying mechanical engineering and psycholoy in [Georgia Tech]()üêù. If you don't mind, why don't you share a bit about yourself as well in the comments? 

### Life Story

I've been interested in engineering for quite a while now -- and, as is true with most other engineers, I've been making, tinkering, and disassembling all sorts of stuff in my house (and failing to assemble back!! ü•≤) for practically forever. 

For around half of my life, I lived in [Incheon, Korea](https://goo.gl/maps/S7aQTsq7WhZoZ1Yq8). That's where I was born and raised. In 2014, my family immigrated to the US, settling in Atlanta, Georgia. We've been living here ever since. 

I am (or, at least, used to be) a huge, **huge** introvert. So the first few years, among the simple and childish--yet somehow intimidating--atmosphere of middle school, things didn't go as well as I planned. In short, I've struggled a bit in socializing with friends... (& enemies, of which there is a *lot* in middle school ü§£) Which also meant that I struggled in picking up English. (FYI: As with all things, things got better with time!)

But that experience -- all the sleepless nights, self-doubts, disheartened days, and escapism -- really built up within me an interest or urge that, at the time, I couldn't fully describe or pursue. And when I discovered psychology (through the loved/hated Myers-Briggs Type Indicator -- you know, the personality test that tells you the four-letter code that, upon reading, *literally describes you*), I knew that I found it. Psychology remains as one of my greatest passions, and likely will continue (for life). 

### Philosophy of Life

`Warning: some potential üåΩness ahead`

So in middle school, thanks to insomnia, I had tons of time to think about all sorts of different things. And once I started to learn about psychology, I saw [a TED talk]() by a guy whose name was Martin Seligman. (If you don't know him---he's a legend, and is known to have started the field of "positive psychology".) In the talk, he makes a point: "If you want to find true happiness, you must find your meaning of life." I was like, 14, so I thought, *... Watchumean? Meaning of life?? Lol what???*, and gamed on. But it stuck in my head, and so I started wondering. 

During that time, I also had a rather childish thought that, when I meet my friends in Korea back again (which was likely the summer after graduating high school---given the financial circumstances), I wanted to be a high-achieving, well-respected person who "made it" and didn't waste the golden opportunity of American Dream that everyone was envious of (or so I thought). In short, I was hungry for success.  

So I kept thinking... until I visited Boston, my first real "trip" since I started living in the States, in May of 2019. I was in the sky lounge of the Prudential Tower where you could see the beautiful night sky of Boston across the Charles River, including the tiniest glimpse of a round dot that was the Great Dome of MIT. Cars were at the size of little ants, and people... people were just dots that were barely visible. It felt like I was looking at a miniature city plan. Except that everyone and everything was real. I could see the dots move, move into a building and disappear, and reappear in other places. It was crazy. I've never looked at that many people at once ever in my life. I (perhaps inaccurately) thought that within my immediate field of view there was a few tens of thousands or even millions of people. Then suddenly, I got it. 

I realized:

> There is no value, no meaning, no specialty in *grinding* or *hustlin,'* when there's an infinite number of other people who are probably smarter, nicer, and [insert adjective] doing the same thing as you are doing, wanting the same things that you want---and guess what? Since you're not the last generation to live on the face of the Earth, go ahead include everyone who are to born in the future to advance, regress, or repeat our efforts---What good is "winning"? Who exactly are you "winning" against? And just how long are you "winning" before you're not anymore? What even is "success"? Based on what definition, defined by whom? Surely you can't be serious when you say, "make the world a better place"---because you can make no difference alone. Doing *anything* <u>alone</u> doesn't get you *anywhere*.  

> What really matters in the end is to learn to collaborate. How to move the hearts, minds, intentions, and actions of people. How to empower and unlock their potential, if they're in some sort of roadblock (like I was when I struggled to learn English). How to communicate well and find a common purpose. 

I know it sounds kind of corny (maybe this whole article sounds corny), but I settled on my personal meaning of life early at age 17. It's two-part: 

1) Spread "<u>**good**</u>"" (however I come to define it) to/with others, to the maximum possible that I am capable of.

2) Enjoy life to the **fullest** by doing "the most "<u>valuable</u>" things. 

(hover: by this, I meant not the easy rushes of dopamine from YouTube, but things like skydiving or mastering electromagnetism that require you to overcome you biggest fears and difficulties).

If I've succeeded in doing these two things, then I would have fulfilled the meaning of my life. These two guidelines help me navigate through difficult decisions in life and stay on the path that I want to stay in, resisting the urge of staying in the comfortable places in ilfe. 

### My Vision(ish)

If the meaning of life is a vector, and the purpose is a direction, the vision would be the magnitude. To have a vision means to zero in onto a specific problem that you are willing to spend a significant amount of resources (and sacrifice a lot of other opportunities) for. 

Unfortunately, I just don't know yet. But I do have candidates.
