    bio: "I'm an engineer who's quite passionate in just about everything in the world. This includes mechanical engineering, software engineering, machine learning, human-computer interaction, design theory, cognitive psychology, 3D graphics, origami, musical instruments, spatial audio, and photography. In spare time, I watch DW Documentary, lie down in bed thinking about things, write, plan out the coming weeks, and majestically procrastinate while doomscrolling through Instagram. Thanks for visiting, and always feel free to reach out! Let's grab coffee and talk."
