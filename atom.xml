And my team built a sensor that detects subcutaneous (under-the-skin) pressure ulcers for our final project! The golden dots placed hexagonally you see in the green, rectangular PCB are surface electrodes, from which we measure bioimpedance (if you are wondering what impedance is – <a href>it’s a complex sibling</a> of electrical resistance). </p><p>You might think, “Wait, that seems like too many electrodes!”, and you’d be right. We are using an analog multiplexer (in fact, <em>four</em> of them) to quickly switch the routes connected to the terminals of the impedance measurement chip, in order to measure the impedance between combination of nearest-neighbors (that’s 42 measurements in total!) In addition, we track the location of each pair when saving the recorded values, and then  process the data in Python to create these awesome heatmap visualizations. Isn’t that cool? </p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/electrode-details.aa258e9a.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/electrode-details.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture></p><p class="text-center">Electrode details. </p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/testing-procedure.48bdffe7.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/testing-procedure.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture></p><p class="text-center">Testing procedures. </p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/lotion-test-human.af6d1259.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/lotion-test-human.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture></p><p class="text-center">Test on human skin with lotion. </p><p>We made everything from scratch (except for the Arduino board and ICs, of course). </p><h1 id="photos"><a href="#photos">Photos</a></h1><p>[<code>TODO</code> photo gallery module kinda like Hackaday, maybe use mouseovers slight-ish (30%) zoom and grid instead of row-list (that’s too naive I don’t like)]</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/finished_down.8c224a1f.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/finished_down.png" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Finished sensor on a breadboard.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/system-diagram.e3fe2852.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/system-diagram.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>System diagram.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/electrode-details.aa258e9a.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/electrode-details.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Electrode details.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/electrical-schematic.d90c8b9d.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/electrical-schematic.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Electrical schematic.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/accuracy-benchmark.83fc0f75.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/accuracy-benchmark.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Accuracy evaluation of impedance circuit.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/testing-procedure.48bdffe7.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/testing-procedure.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Testing procedure.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/burn-test-pig.887d575e.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/burn-test-pig.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Test on burnt pig skin.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/lotion-test-pig.b8d80aca.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/lotion-test-pig.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Test on pig skin with lotion.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/_app/immutable/assets/lotion-test-human.af6d1259.avif 736w" type="image/avif">    <img src="/bioimpedance/lotion-test-human.jpg" alt="img" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></picture>Test on human skin with lotion.</p><br><h1 id="choosing-the-problem"><a href="#choosing-the-problem">Choosing the Problem</a></h1><blockquote><p>shortened problem paragraph, with visuals or graphics to show impact</p></blockquote><h3 id="search-for-impact"><a href="#search-for-impact">Search for Impact</a></h3><p>When we started looking for ideas for the final project, we realized that most wearable sensors in the literature sounded nice on paper but had little implications for the medical community.

Just like we use the notion of <em>resolution</em> (and sometimes <em>frame rate</em>) to denote the information density of visual media, different senses have varying degrees of sensory resolutions. We cannot expect a system that naively transmits all information in maximum bandwidth to “just work” – which is why I started to work on RTVA, a research dashboard containing efficient implementations of modern computer vision algorithms.</p><p>In context of VTSS, the <strong>density of mechanosensory receptors</strong> in the skin determine such sensory resolution. Mechanoreceptors are most densely packed in areas such as tongue and fingertips, which makes sense, given that Braille, a <a href>relatively</a> successfuly accessibility medium, uses tactile dots that are read via fingertips. </p><p>We decided to use the Braille system as a proxy (or a baseline) of our exploration, using fingertips as the primary interface as well as the six-dot configuration that Braille users are already familiar with. </p><h3 id="intelligent-filtering"><a href="#intelligent-filtering">Intelligent Filtering</a></h3><p>[<code>TODO</code> RTVA is a link]</p><p>Real-Time Visual Analyzer (RTVA) is a simple and modular script written in Python that contains inference-optimized implementations of algorithms such as object detection, instance segmentation, holistic edge detection, hand tracking, facial mesh </p><h3 id="localization"><a href="#localization">Localization</a></h3><p>From a hardware perspective, a TipLet is simply a wireless, battery-powered board with six vibration motors.

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[using cost-effective manufacturing processes to create affordable EMG electrodes]]></summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<h1 id="intro"><a href="#intro">Intro</a></h1><p>EMG sensors measure the extremely small voltages that your muscles generate when they are activated. The combination of multiple EMG sensors targeting different muscles with <em>machine learning</em> allows you to predict what kinds of motion you are making—and even how much force you are exerting to your muscles (even if there’s no visible motion)!—which is something completely unique to the EMG class of sensors. </p><p><code>PCB-EMG</code> aims to be the <em>Arduino</em> of EMGs. What this means is that it aims to bring a research-grade technology (that comes with research-grade price tag) to an openly available technology with consumer- and developer-friendly products. How? By 1) dramatically lowering the cost &amp; difficulty of manufacturing processes, and 2) creating a public knowledge base of how exactly they work. One good word for this process is <strong>democratization</strong>, and it is how <code>Arduino</code> and <code>Raspberry Pi</code> transformed the worlds of electronisc and single-board computing forever—by inviting developers, tinkerers, and hobbyists of all levels to produce all sorts of awesome applications with them—and drove the emergence of the IoT boom. </p><p>I am wildly passionate in human-computer interaction, because I believe that it is <em>one</em> area that we have never truly revolutionized (computer mice are as old as computers themselves, and if you think about it, keyboards/typewriters date back to even earlier times!). Visit the <a href>Buxton Gallery</a> to see what I mean. </p><p>PCB-EMG consists of three main parts: 1) a low-cost, high-performance electrode, 2) a wristband consisting of multiple electrodes, and 3) a complementary machine learning system to support gesture recognition and hand pose estimation tasks. Let’s dive deeper, step by step.</p><p>The electrode of PCB-EMG takes advantage of ENIG (electroless nickel plated gold; a surface finish that has become a standard in electronics manufacturing) to produce low-cost yet high-performance EMG electrodes. The viability of this approach has been <a href>previously demonstrated</a>. The operating specifics of electrodes are surprisnigly complex. For one, they are not electric devices; they are electrochemical devices that actually interact with the </p><h1 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h1><p>Up until 2020, the field of EMG was full of potential and excitements, thanks to a notable company, <a href>Thalmic Labs</a>, came out with a product called the Myo Armband that offered the best-in-class performance with a consumer-level price tag of $250. More than X papers have been published so far, using the Myo to create groundbreaking human-computer interaction experiments that were not possible before</p><p>There was just one problem: all the pre-existing EMG sensors were too expensive (especially considering that the technology itself is nothing special—it’s just some high-precision instrumentation amplifiers, coupled with meh-grade electrodes typical in medical usages), and the literature around how the technology works was very opaque, with almost no public-facing knowledge base that explained how to implement them, and even academic papers skimping on crucial details in equipment and instrumentation methodologies. This was surprising given: 1) the widespread adoption of open-source practices in areas such as software engineering and additive manufacturing machines i.e., 3D printers, and 2) that EMG (or by its full name: electromyography) has been in existence for decades, with papers being published all the way back from 1970s. </p><p><code>Graph: existing EMG devices in the market</code></p><p>I really don’t like it when things are unnecessarily expensive, and when markets fail to serve the people it’s supposed to serve. There really was no fundamental reason that EMG manufacturers should be charging what they were currently charging (easily upwards of $1,000 per channel) for clinical uses; </p><p>I didn’t like it</p><p>PCB-EMG was my first “real” electronics project. As such, it meant the most trials-and-error encountered in the process. Working on it, I had to learn how to read datasheets (which is intimidating at first, full of unknown jargons, words of caution and warnings), what a typical electronics design workflow looks like (one big mistake was completing a design before realizing that a crucial component was out of stock for a while!), </p><p>reading these signals, you can actually</p><p>millivolt-level electricity that is generated from your muscle</p><p>The goal was to explore using cost-effective manufacturing processes to create affordable EMG (electromyography) electrodes that could be used for prosthesis control or assistive technologies.</p>]]>
